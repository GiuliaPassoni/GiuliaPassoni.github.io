When there’s a match, users can interpret the interface based on conventions they’re already familiar with.\n\nThe second address field forces the user to type their address in the system’s preferred format, not the user’s. In the real world, users think of addresses as a single entity. Two text fields causes them to perceive their address as separate entities. Users don’t expect to see this which is why they get confused.\n\n\nReal World Expectations\n-----------------------\n\nIt’s important to design your form based on the user’s real world expectations. If you force users to rethink conventions in order to match the system, you’ll confuse and frustrate them. Don’t force the user to follow the system, force the system to follow the user. -->\n","html":"<!-- Have you ever filled out a form and froze on the address field?
