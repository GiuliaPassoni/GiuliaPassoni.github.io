This project was the perfect opportunity for me to take drawing more seriously. My images were selected because of their <em>"children-friendly"</em> and <em>"cute"</em> look. While it is always good to hear that you have met the brief, so to speak, this work is not intended to be the definiton of my style. On the contrary, I want to develop it further, and evole it into something different, more aligned with what I like.

If you are intrigued by the pictures and wish to read the (also very cute) story, hold tight! The book will soon be available for purchase [here](https:// and link here).
